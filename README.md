# rust-mumbai

## the rust paradox:
`rust is the most loved language by developers`
 - really only by developers who have experienced rust

## common myths that need busting:
 - rust is too complex for freasher/junior developers; you need experience with simpler languages first
 - learning rust takes very long
 - 2 weeks minimum to get anything done in rust
 - my requirments are too small to use rust
 - rust needs dedicated time; can't learn it when working on BAU
 - rust only makes sense if you need extremely efficient performance; we will switch to rust when we need that much performance
 - don't have anyone to ask if i get stuck up
 - the rust ecosystem and community is not mature yet

my objective here is to create very simple ~100 line rust code that does something meaningful for each domain/genre. It has a potential to inspire someone from that domain/genre to take an interest in rust within 30 min.
